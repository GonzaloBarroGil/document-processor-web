description: Execute implementation tasks following TDD — Red → Green → Refactor
agent: implementer
subtask: true
model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro
---
Execute the next pending implementation task from the plan.
Follow TDD strictly (Vitest + React Testing Library): write failing test → write code → verify green → refactor.
Keep `tsc --noEmit` and ESLint clean; use the generated client for all API calls.
One task per invocation. Report results to HITL after each task.

Load context from the family constitution (`document-processor-orchestration/docs/constitution.md`),
